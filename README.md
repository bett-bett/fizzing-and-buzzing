Python

Given an integer n, return a string array answer (1-indexed) where:
answer[i] == "FizzBuzz" if i is divisible by 3 and 5.

answer[i] == "Fizz" if i is divisible by 3.

answer[i] == "Buzz" if i is divisible by 5.

answer[i] == i (as a string) if none of the above conditions are true.

Constraints:
1 <= n <= 104
